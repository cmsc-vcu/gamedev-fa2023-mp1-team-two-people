CMSC391/COAR463 Game Development - Minor Project 1

Great job on creating your own copy of the minor project 1 scaffold!

Be sure to review the resources on the Canvas site Week 6:

To learn more about writing good README.md files, see:

This is a scaffold project. Iâ€™ll be providing scaffolds throughout the
semester to get you working faster, and to make grading much easier for
the TA team.

Good luck!

Our game is a player vs player sword fighting game. 
Player 1 moves back and forth with A and D while using Q to swing their sword. 
Player 2 uses the Left and Right Arrow keys to move and the Right Shift key to swing their sword.
Each player can take 5 hits before they are defeated.
Battle your friends and see who wins!
